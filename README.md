# Pizza-Sales-Analysis-MySQL-and-Power-BI
I analyzed the pizza sales dataset from a pizza place to provide sales insights.

Description :

Conducted in-depth analysis using MySQL to identify the highest priced pizza, most ordered pizza and pizza type, peak hour for maximum orders of pizza, and sales performance. Created interactive visualizations in Power BI, including bar and pie charts for percentage sales by product category, time series charts for sales trends, top 5 best sellers and bottom 5 worst sellers based on revenue, quantity, and orders. Developed comprehensive dashboards summarizing key performance indicators (KPIs) to provide actionable insights for optimizing operations, improving sales, and enhancing customer satisfaction.

Problem Statement :

Write SQL queries for the following:
1. Retrieve the total number of orders placed.
2. Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
3. Identify the highest-priced pizza.
4. Identify the most common pizza size ordered.
5. List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.
6. Join the relevant tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
7. Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
8. Join the relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.
9. Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
10. Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.
11. Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.
12. Analyse the cumulative revenue generated over time.
13. Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.

Getting Started :

Knowledge on writing queries using aggregate functions, joins, and common table expressions (CTE). Information on data cleaning and transformation using Power Query Editor and simple Data Analysis Expression (DAX) in Power BI. Usage of MySQL Workbench 8.0 and Power BI Desktop.

Created following dashboards for the same using Power BI:
